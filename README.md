# BDD With Cucumber - Discount Calculator

This sample project demonstrates how we could practice Behavior 
Driven Development (BDD) using the [Cucumber.io](https://cucumber.io/) 
library.

The project is a simple discount calculator; the greater the total 
purchase amount, the bigger the calculated discount.

## Documentation

One of the greatest things about 
[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) is the explicit documentation 
that the [*.feature](./src/test/resources/features) files define.  For 
this project, we do not need to write any explicit documentation.  If 
you want to know what the code does (or should do), read the 
[*.feature](./src/test/resources/features) files!
